Shout out to Emma Catnip who runs the [IDM facebook group][0] for drawing my attention to this artist and his track, "**27**" which is going to be coming out soon on his new album. I am giving Ned Rush this spot because of what he has achieved in his sound, a nuanced nod towards well known IDM artists whilst keeping a firm hold of that coveted streak known as originality. A really fresh break, with evolving sound design to keep you hooked all the way through. Excellent granular sound with sweet wavesynth manipulation. It's quite impressive when you learn that Ned Rush has adhered to concepts that some would find very limiting, such as using one midi note to play the entire track. The video is interesting too!  
Ned Rush is about to release his new album entitled "Unsubscribe", which going by his preview tracks is worth following to it's aimed release of the 16th of September 2016\. You can join the release event [here.][1]

Thank you visiting and for reading - [philjo][2]
